# Python-Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. I have analysed the Data of Covid-19 and presented the detailed data visualisation of it.
The interesting part of this project is that it has used the sub-dataset of Covid-19 from Kaggle and the flow of Data is less in Error and Missing Values.

# To Run it Locally::
  - After downloading the Zip Code, One will be the HTML format Preview of the Project. And the Other one will be in the form of Python Code.
  - Run the Python Code in Jupyter Notebook by Creating a Python 3 File.

# The Basics of Pandas and Plotting Graphs are being Covered in this project.
- Importing Libraries like Pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn.
- Creating DataFrames.
- Extracting out Null Values.
- Presenting Value in Detail Format using Groupby Function.
- Linearmap graph is also included which is usually used for Machine Learning Concepts.
